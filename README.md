# Shooting_Strategy
---
This rep, created by Si-yu Derrick ZHANG and matined by CV\&AI group of Artinx@SUSTech, is nothing other than a mathematical modeling for the strategy of shooting.

Two parts are contained in this rep:

1. Mathematical Models, both for HP_lose because of a over heating gun and for damage on enemy
2. Optimization Algorithm : At present, only PSO is included. (which is bascially because I'm not familiar with any other optimization method )
